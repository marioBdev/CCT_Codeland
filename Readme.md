## README

This is CA1 2022 about data analisis.

I have got my data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priteshraj10/covid-vaccination-all-countries-data)

It's recommended to leave inside the same folder this file project and the dataframe to get  the best location path and be able to run this ".R" file.
